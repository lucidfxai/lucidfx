  - Docker gpu instance.
  - set up api call to call the model to upscale video.
  - ML model should upscale the video and return a url to the upscaled video.

FE should have a payment structure to be able to pay for the service.


Have model run on nvidia t4 docker container. So thats 16gb vram.
So likely using FP16. 



To Do:
------

- Configure GCP for this docker container.
  - Likely will involve GKE autoscaler.
- Configure 2 cloud storage buckets for pre/post upscaled vid.
- Enable user to upload video to pre storage bucket.
- Execute upscale for video from storage bucket.
- Enable user to download upscaled video.
- Implement payment processor.
- Implement core business logic.


In Progress:
------------
- Feature/basicvsrplusplus 
  - Build docker GPU image that can upscale videos. - Test with docker exec
